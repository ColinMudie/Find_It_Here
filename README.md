## Foresight

The future technologies of this website should include suggested Movies or TV shows of the same genre/ type.

Driven by having to search for a movie in multiple places, having a website that displays all of the available major streaming platforms in one place will expedite my movie-going experience.

Some challenges of this webpage consisted of merging the code and having and dealing with merging conflicts. Getting the api endpoint to render properly. Also, implementing new foundation layout.

## Solution

Using multiple API's to help the user to find their movie of choice and its streaming locations in one search.
